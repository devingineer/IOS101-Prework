# Prework - *RGB Me*

Submitted by: **Devin Khun**

**RGB Me** is an app that is a minimalist, fun personal app that flashes my name, school, and aspiring career on the screen. Tap the button and the background color shifts to a new random vibe. It's like your personality in RGB.

An app idea I'd like to build is called *Loop*, a social accountability platform for habit-building and goal tracking. It’s like a fusion of Habitica, BeReal, and group chat. Users set daily or weekly goals, like hitting the gym, reading, or practicing a skill, and "check in" with photo/video proof to a small, trusted circle. It would include a streak system, gentle nudges, and even shared group challenges (e.g. everyone drinks 64oz of water for a week). I’d add lightweight social features like emoji reactions and comment threads. Privacy settings would be tight because not everyone wants their self-improvement broadcasted to the world. The goal is to make consistency feel fun, social, and a little less lonely.

## Notes

One small challenge was getting used to the UI of Xcode and navigating through the different sections of the Xcode platform.
